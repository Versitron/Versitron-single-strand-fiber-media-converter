## Single Strand Fiber Media Converter

**Efficient fiber-optical conversion using only one fiber strand for both transmit and receive.**

- Enables bi-directional transmission over a **single strand of single-mode fiber (simplex)** using different wavelengths. :contentReference[oaicite:0]{index=0}  
- Reduces fiber cabling and infrastructure cost while maintaining full duplex communication. :contentReference[oaicite:1]{index=1}  
- Supports 10/100Base and Gigabit (1000Base) Ethernet speeds via single-fiber links. :contentReference[oaicite:2]{index=2}  
- Ideal for remote or long-distance links where deploying additional fiber is cost-prohibitive.

## Single Fiber Optic Media Converter

**Reliable fiber conversion solution for point-to-point or remote network segments.**

- Converts Ethernet (copper RJ45) to fiber optic link using a single fiber strand, or transitions existing fiber installations into higher performance networks. :contentReference[oaicite:3]{index=3}  
- Supports auto-negotiation, auto MDI/MDI-X, and standard IEEE Ethernet protocols so the network behaves seamlessly. :contentReference[oaicite:4]{index=4}  
- Designed for industrial, utility, campus, or enterprise deployment where fiber distance or EMI conditions require optical links.

## Single Fiber WDM Media Converter

**Wave-Division Multiplexing (WDM) media converters for single-fiber, long-reach links.**

- Uses two different wavelengths (for example TX 1310 nm / RX 1550 nm) to transmit and receive over one single-mode fiber strand. :contentReference[oaicite:5]{index=5}  
- Allows for high-speed network link (10/100/1000Base or higher) without laying a second fiber. :contentReference[oaicite:6]{index=6}  
- Suitable for industrial, metro, utility, and remote installations where fiber capacity or conduit is limited.
